<h4>What is conflict Mineral Anyway?</h4>
<h4>Did you know that the war in Eastern Congo is the deadliest war since World War 2, and in modern history,
    with an estimated 5.4M death toll? source:<a

    Despite uncovered media attention on such a magnitude conflict, we at CMBuzz urge you to pose yourself some logical
    questions.

    What makes the Eastern Congo war, a civil war, if the conflict involves 9 different African nations, within the same
    region?

    Take a close look at Congo's mineral resources map showing a concentration of resources in Eastern Congo. Tell us
    what you see.

    Now I think you are starting to connect the dots.
    Isn't that intriguing that the region that is the most terrorized by rapes and other violent abuses, is the same
    region that
    has all of the conflict Minerals (here after "Coltan").

    How much easier is it to control these resources, when all inhabitants have fled as being displaced by the war.

    All that the war loads have to do is to instill terror. You can help by demanding that your electronic devices
    confirm
    the provenance sources of these precious resources.
